   "Provenance": "Provenance\n\nPunjab University, Chandigarh, India; Galerie 54, Paris\n\nCatalogue Essay\n\nDuring the Partition of India in 1947, Punjab lost Lahore, its capital, to Pakistan. In his haste to quit the heat, Border Commissions chair Sir Cyril Radcliffe had drawn a reckless line through towns, fields, even houses. In the Punjab alone, ten million Muslims, Hindus, and Sikhs were displaced. Radcliffe had never been to India before and only stayed five weeks.\n\nAddressing the urgent need for a Punjabi capital, Prime Minister Nehru commissioned the planning and construction of Chandigarh, a model city to be built in the foothills of the Himalayas. Named for the Hindu goddess Chandi (bearer of lotus and lightning), Chandigarh would function as the symbol of a progressive and auspicious Indian future.\n\nAmerican planner Albert Mayer and Polish architect Matthew Nowicki drafted the first drawings of the city, a rectangular grid of ‘superblocks’ intended to house 500,000 residents. Nowicki died in a plane crash in 1950, and Mayer withdrew from the project. In their stead, Le Corbusier and his cousin Pierre Jeanneret undertook the design and completion of the capital complex, including ‘sectors’ for housing, government offices, industry, and commerce. Jeanneret became chief architect after Le Corbusier’s own departure in 1959.\n\nAided by admiring Indian colleagues, Jeanneret built a series of residential and civic buildings including the dramatic Ghandi Bhawan, the library of Ghandian studies at Punjab University. Its canted roofs, like wings, expressed the lofty aspirations of the project. For Jeanneret, no detail was too small; he designed lampposts, manhole covers, paddle boats—everything. Out of necessity, and with respect for his surroundings, he employed local craftsmen to build with local materials.\n\nBefore the Second World War, Jeanneret was a steady presence in his cousin’s Paris atelier. His furniture for Chandigarh reflects the rational principles proclaimed by Le Corbusier decades earlier in Towards a New Architecture (1923). In the case of the present library table, load bearing is shifted from outer legs (which impede the legs) to internal pilotis; the projecting top extends beyond the supports, giving the impression of lightness despite its massive size.A long strip of glass, like a ribbon window, unifies the composition while ensuring privacy.\n\nUnlike Sir Radcliffe’s recess, Jeanneret’s fifteen year stay in India was a lifetime. Architectural critic Patwant Singh wrote: “His solutions were not impatient impositions.” Jeanneret helped build by hand what Radcliffe’s arbitrary sweep could not: a modern India. When Jeanneret returned to Europe in 1965, ill and unable to work, he reportedly lamented, “I am leaving my home and going to a foreign country.” His ashes, returned to Chandigarh, were scattered on Lake Sukhna.",

Named after the Hindu goddess Chandi (bearer of lotus and lightning), Chandigarh would function as the symbol of a progressive and auspicious India.\n\nAmerican planner Albert Mayer and Polish architect Matthew Nowicki drafted the first drawings of the city, a rectangular grid of ‘superblocks’ intended to house 500,000 residents. Nowicki died in a plane crash in 1950, and Mayer withdrew from the project. In their stead, Le Corbusier and his cousin Pierre Jeanneret undertook the design and completion of the capitol complex, including the ‘sectors’ for housing, government offices, and industry. Jeanneret became chief architect after Le Corbusier’s departure in 1959.\n\nAided by admiring Indian colleagues, Jeanneret built a series of residential and civic buildings including the dramatic Ghandi Bhawan, the library of Ghandian studies at Punjab University. For Jeanneret, no detail was too small; he designed furniture, lampposts, manhole covers, paddle boats-everything. The architectural critic Patwant Singh wrote: ‘His solutions were not impatient impositions.’ Jeanneret achieved to build what the border Commissions chair Sir Cyril Radcliffe could not: a modern India. When Jeanneret returned to Europe in 1965, ill and unable to work, he reportedly lamented, ‘I am leaving my home and going to a foreign country.’ His ashes were returned to Chandigarh and scattered on Lake Sukhna.",

The top presents with some significant abrasion to the varnish/the finish in the middle. The bottom of one leg presents with a larger chip. This desk was originally conceived with a light above the proper left side, which has been removed at some point in the history of the piece, as on most of the PJ-BU-11-A desks.",

The new capital of Chandigarh was to be a symbol of the nation’s faith in the future and a step toward a modern India. Indian Prime Minister Jawaharal Nehru enlisted Le Corbusier, as an icon of European Modernism, to take on the task of planning the new capital city. Chandigarh is Le Corbusier’s only city plan ever to be actually executed.\n\nWhile Le Corbusier was the head architect and planner on this project, Pierre Jeanneret, Le Corbusier’s cousin, acted as the foreman to this endeavor, spending near 15 years of his life devoted to seeing the project through. Jeanneret also designed many of the interiors and furnishings for the public buildings in Chandigarh, utilizing local materials and manpower. He stayed on in Chandigarh after its construction, advising the local government in his appointed capacity as Chief Architect of the city and upon his death his ashes were scattered in the lake at Chandigarh.",

Le Corbusier's designs typically provided an aesthetic of openness and purity. For the city plan of Chandigarh, his practice shifted. His structures appeared pre-historic, reflecting a crude, more sculptural style. He maintained that space was of the utmost importance, always thinking in terms of large scale buildings and equally large open spaces.\n \nLe Corbusier's cousin, Pierre Jeanneret, served as his partner for the Chandigarh project. Like Le Corbusier, Jeanneret's style expanded from being cool and mechanical to incorporate the style and symbols of Eastern philosophy. For example, his masterpiece, the Gandhi Bhawan, appears to float in a body of water on the University campus, resembling a lotus flower. In an effort to bring beauty and comfort to everyone in Chandigarh, he designed modest buildings and homes as well as the University campus and library.\n Jeanneret designed many interiors and furnishings for private and public buildings in Chandigarh. Through his 'Low Cost Furniture' program, he worked with local materials and with the aid of city residents, allowing him to incorporate native craftsmanship into his own designs. Because of his devotion to the Chandigarh project, he became a member of the community, and he was named Chief Architect of the city. He was forced to leave in 1965 due to health issues and upon his death two years later, Jeanneret's ashes were, at his request, scattered on Sukhna Lake in Chandigarh.",

The clever execution of the base design, in which the upper section rests within the framework of the lower section, is reminiscent of ancient furniture forms such as the cross-leg table and X-frame stool. Symbolically, the base form is an instance of the intersecting horns motif that Le Corbusier employed throughout his career. Several versions of the design were produced, with variations in size and the manner in which the base armature connects to the tabletop.",

There are various small areas of old infill to the legs, particularly along the bases just above where they connect to the ground. The surfaces of the legs have been very lightly cleaned and applied with a light varnish. The top laminate may have been replaced, however not recently. The top laminate appears to have been made from a form of Indian teak with feint dark striations to the grain. The underside of the top has oxidation and dark age-related patination. The areas beneath the top where the legs connect to the underside are paler in color/less oxidized and patinated. The underside of the legs where they connect to the ground display wear commensurate with age and consistent use. The surfaces of the top have been re-varnished, but this does not appear to have been done recently, there is age deterioration to the varnish. Overall in our opinion the table presents well, and retains a firm structure. Further photographs of the table may be supplied on request.",

To this end, William Henry Vanderbilt, the son of railroad tycoon Cornelius Vanderbilt, commissioned an elaborately carved and inlaid library table from Herter Brothers (now in the collection of The Metropolitan Museum of Art) dripping with symbols of his power and prestige. About twenty years later, Gustav Stickley designed an entirely different version, his leather-topped, hexagonal library table, model no. 625, which featured exposed joinery in keeping with the Arts and Crafts credo of honest craftsmanship, and which he included in his own residence, Craftsman Farms, in Morris Plains, New Jersey.\nHalf a century later, Pierre Jeanneret was tasked with designing the furniture for the administrative and university buildings of the city of Chandigarh, the newly-formed capital of Punjab, for which his cousin Le Corbusier served as master city planner. The princely states having been dissolved following Indian independence, Le Corbusier envisioned Chandigarh as a modernist utopia for the people of the region. In keeping with Le Corbusier's modernist program, Jeanneret created solid, minimal designs that were beautiful yet functional, drawing on local materials and craftsmen for the execution of his designs.\nWhile Vanderbilt and Stickley's library tables were luxury products, albeit in very different ways, the present illuminated reading table is design with a social conscience, created to serve a large population. Through an economy of means that emphasizes form and surface over ornament, Jeanneret achieved his own elegant interpretation of what a library table can represent.",

   "Provenance": "CATALOGUE NOTE\nThe Pigeonhole Desk was designed during the famous Chandigarh project in India for the Secretariat and various administrative buildings in Chandigarh, India. When India gained independence in 1947, Nehru decided to commission a contemporary architect for the creation of the new capital of the Punjab region, which would become Chandigarh. Le Corbusier's project was designed to illustrate the bright future of the new country. The commission also included the creation of all the furniture for administrative buildings and housing. For the design of the furniture, Le Corbusier chose Pierre Jeanneret, his cousin and lifelong collaborator. Both of these architects-designers' styles remained eminently modern, while respectful of Indian savoir-faire and craftsmanship. ",

   "Provenance": "Provenance\n\nPrivate residence, Chandigarh, circa 1953-1954\nAcquired from the above by Maxwell Fry and Jane Drew, 63 Gloucester Place, London, 1954\nThence by descent to the present owner, granddaughter of Jane Drew, Canterbury, 1996\n\nLiterature\n\nBeryl Platts, 'The Architect As Collector, The Modern Collection Of Maxwell Fry And Jane Drew’, Country Life, 29 September, 1966, illustrated p. 782, fig. 2\nEric Touchaleaume and Gerald Moreau, Le Corbusier, Pierre Jeanneret, The Indian Adventure: Design-Art-Architecture, Paris, 2010, pp. 268, 323, 588\n\nCatalogue Essay\n\nThe second-floor landing at 63 Gloucester Place was the location of the present lot after Edwin Maxwell Fry (1899-1987) and Dame Jane Beverly Drew (1911-1996) departed from the city in 1954. They both arrived at Chandigarh in 1951, although Jane arrived a little later due to her commitments for the Festival of Britain. The table remained part of the Fry’s conscientious and refined collection until it became part of Jane Drew’s estate and thence by descent to her granddaughter.\n\nSet within a Regency Terrace, 63 Gloucester Place was not only the Fry and Drew residence it was also the location of the firm Fry, Drew and Partners. The author Beryl Platts best describes the terrace in the following article after visiting Jane Drew at Gloucester Place as: ‘tall, dignified houses, whose successive owners have made them taller by adding a froth of gay attic storeys. High ceilings, wide landings and tall windows seem to set the pace for free-ranging futuristic ideas’ (Beryl Platts, 'The architect As Collector, The Modern Collection Of Maxwell Fray And Jane Drew’, Country Life, 29 September, 1966, p. 782). The intriguing title of this article ‘The Architect As Collector’ is the concept that it presents the architect as the modern collector and compared to the surfeit amount of contemporary articles that appear on today’s platforms, these are generally somewhat focused on anodyne collections and interiors, but the Fry’s deploy intellectual juxtapositions throughout their interior and for example they superimpose the present lot with a sculpture by the artist Gerald Gladstone. It is most likely that the present lot can be considered the first example of Pierre Jeanneret’s furniture designed for Chandigarh to be acquired and contextualised as part of a collection specifically within an interior.\n\nThe present lot applies many of the design principles and sensibilities of the work that Pierre Jeanneret did in collaboration with Charlotte Perriand when working on a series of furniture for L’Équipment de la Maison. It was an ambitious project that began in 1946, which included a comprehensive and essential range of furniture that could be easily built by hand and constructed. L’Équipment de la Maison was rigorous in its approach to produce robust furniture devoid of decoration and most importantly that it could be executed using traditional techniques without machine aided manufacturing methods. Much of this brief would have been applied to the process of the furniture design and construction at Chandigarh. The present lot appears to be a rarefied version of the two other examples shown within the period images of Jeaneret’s apartment and possibly an associate’s apartment in Chandigarh. In comparison the overall form of the present lot appears to be more dynamic, the scale is more refined and the tabletop has a bevelled edge. Overall the present lot has a superior build quality, which can be seen when demounted and displayed in its three component parts.\n\nCompared to Le Corbusier’s contractual biannual month long visits to Chandigarh, Jeanneret, Fry and Drew were the three from the quartet that worked as senior architects for the expected duration of three years. All four were members of the CIAM. The principal, I J S Bakshi of the Chandigarh College of Architecture writes in regards to Fry and Drew that ‘These were the pioneers who worked assiduously and painstakingly in the face of all adversity’ and further more with the inclusion of Jeanneret ‘that [they] gave visual form to Chandigarh and are a vital link in the chain of its development. Their value needs to be impressed upon public consciousness’. The power of the Le Corbusier myth has marginalised much of the important work produced in Chandigarh by Jeanneret, Fry and Drew. While in Chandigarh Fry and Drew extensively contributed to the planning of Sector-22 and they also employed and trained local staff. Iain Jackson writes in his essay that ‘Fry and Drew are extremely important figures in British twentieth-century architecture and their position as leaders in the tropical architectural field is unquestioned’ (‘Maxwell Fry and Jane Drew’s early housing and neighbourhood planning in Sector-22, Chandigarh’, Planning Perspectives, Vol. 28, No. 1, 2013, p. 1).",

The seats of the stools are slightly shiny in appearance. The seats with a few very shallow surface scratches and a few occasional minor edge nicks. The top of the stool with the blue legs with a minor imperfection to the finish which measures 1/8 inch in diameter. The metal legs on each of the stools with losses and rubbing to the finish throughout, as seen in the catalogue illustration. Please note, these two stools are slightly different in height.

Following the country's independence in 1947 a new city was planned to be built in the foothills of the Himalayas. The city named Chandigarh was planned as a confident expression of Nehru's dreams for a new India. Le Corbusier was the most notable of three architects who were employed to realise Nehru's dream for a new city of space, light, fresh air and modernity. Le Corbusier's cousin Pierre Jeanneret was employed to design furniture for many of the buildings.\n",

Jeanneret worked with the local Indian materials, which were new to him, to create novel forms for these pieces. The present chair, with its simple materials, is a testament to Jeanneret's pioneering spirit. Hélène Bauchet-Cauquil says about Jeanneret: \"Another part of his activity was the creation of pieces of furniture using rough lumber, bamboo, plaited straw, rope, webbing, cereal baskets, concrete framework, objects that even the poorest could afford. These objects were turned into chairs, tables, lamps and beds that furnished his house and constituted models that were accessible to everyone.\"\n(Architectures en Inde, Paris, 1986, p. 109)\n\nThe present chair is one of very few that were made and it is the only one of this model that has been found to this date.

The main hall of the building is divided into three color-coded areas furnished with chairs in red, green or yellow leather with matching carpets (see p. 105). The walls of the rooms adjoining the Assembly hall are decorated with Le Corbusier's tapestries and also furnished with chairs of this model, some of which are covered in blue leather.\n\nColor played an important role in the architecture of Le Corbusier, who was particularly interested in the study of color, culminating in the creation of the 1931 Salubra color catalogue. Pierre Jeanneret equally used primary colors for some of his own Chandigarh furniture designs, such as the architect's stools and desks from the College of Architecture.",
